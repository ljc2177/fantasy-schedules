    "All non-conference teams will be played once, and the rest of the games will be made up of conference teams. If the total conference games is divisible by the number of conference teams minus one (how many teams each team would need to play within their conference), then each team will play the teams in their conference however many times that is. If it is not divisible, All confernece teams will be played a minimum number of games, followed by however many games need to be played to hit the total number of games and each team will not be played the same number of times. For best results, make sure the number of weeks after all non-conference games are played is divisible by conference teams minus one."
